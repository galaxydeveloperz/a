This directory is for the 'Pages' and 'FAQ' sections in your admin control panel.

Create files here with a '.tpl.php' extension.


# PAGES
=========================


Specify file as the load file when adding/editing a new page. Template files must NOT be prefixed with
a 'faq_' prefix, these are for faq questions only. See below.

This will override the system default file and enable you to add in your own PHP for different pages.


# FAQ
=========================


Specify file as the load file when adding/editing a new FAQ question. Template files must NOT be prefixed with
a 'page_' prefix, these are for custom pages only. See below.

This will override the system default file and enable you to add in your own PHP for different pages.
