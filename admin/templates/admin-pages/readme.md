This directory is for the 'Settings & Tools > Admin Pages' sections in your admin control panel.

Create files here with a '.php' extension.


# PAGES
=========================


Specify file as the load file when adding/editing a new page.

This will override the system default file and enable you to add in your own PHP for different pages.
