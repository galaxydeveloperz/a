     When the system is installed, a staff administrator (global user) is created. This staff member cannot be deleted to prevent you from locking yourself out of the system. This staff
     member has access to all areas of the admin interface regardless of access and permission settings. It will <b>always</b> default to an administrator account.<br><br>
     Other administrators can be added (see below). <br><br>
     Note that other staff administrators cannot perform the following for security:<br><br>
     <b>1</b>. Edit the main global or default administrator.<br>
     <b>2</b>. Set another staff member as administrator
