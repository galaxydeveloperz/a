     your data to the API.<br><br>
     Note that if visitors can open tickets without an account, they can simply choose another email address (as the check is only against the email address).

       IMPORTANT: If a team member has a ticket list screen open and they open tickets in new tabs, then close the tabs, the locks WILL NOT be released. The locks
       only release if they refresh or navigate away from the ticket list screen. If this is the case, the locks must be manually cleared. If this feature proves
       unpredictable, please disable it. OR make your staff members aware of how they should view tickets.

	   area. Once a standard ticket is created, you have the option when viewing a ticket to change it to a dispute. Once this is done, you can give multiple visitors access to
	   the same ticket. This is useful for example, for gaming websites that regularly have disputes between members. More on disputes <a href="disputes-rules.html">here</a>.<br><br>
	   <span class="highlightText">After Each Visitor Response, Allow No Further Replies Until Admin Has Responded</span> - This disables any further visitor replies until admin has responded. This can

	     The following are available for the 'Tickets by Email (Imap)' option only and DO NOT require the cleanTalk system to be enabled. If the CleanTalk system is enabled, this check comes first and the cleanTalk second.<br><br>
	     <span class="highlightText">(IMAP ONLY) Spam Score Header Name (To honour server restriction. eg: X-Spam-Score)</span> - If your server is checking for spam (most servers use SpamAssassin), then a spam score header may
	     be present with the spam score value. You'll need to contact your host if you aren't sure. If you enter an invalid value the
	     Maian Support system will ignore the check. The SpamAssassin header is called 'X-Spam-Score';<br><br>
	     <span class="highlightText">(IMAP ONLY) Spam Ticket Detected When Spam Score Header is Greater Than or Equal To (0 to disable)</span> - Enter the lowest value that you want Maian Support
	     to reject messages. For example, if you enter 2, any messages that have a spam score value of 2 or more will be rejected. Enter whole or half values ONLY, anything else is stripped from the spam
	     score header. Examples: 2, 3.5, 4 etc. Set to 0 to disable. <br><br>
	     Note that the value that is in the spam score header in the actual emails is determined by your server. If the setting is too aggressive, make the changes on your server. Maian Support
	     has no control over the values that are allocated to the spam score. So, for example if an email is incorrectly flagged as
	     spam because of a spam score of 5, this is determined by your server settings.

	     <span class="highlightText">For Standard Tickets Disable if Visitor is Logged In</span> - Enable this to disable spam check if a visitor is logged in to their account when creating a ticket.<br><br>
       <span class="highlightText">For Imap Tickets Disable if Account is Already Active</span> - Enable this to disable spam check if an account is already verified and active when a ticket is received by email.<br><br>
       <span class="highlightText">If Spam Ticket Detected, Add to Spam Tickets</span> - If enabled, ticket isn`t deleted, it get`s moved to <a href="spam.html">Spam Tickets</a>. If not enabled, ticket is not allowed and deleted.<br><br>
       <span class="highlightText">When Moving Tickets to Spam, Also Disable Account</span> - If enabled, account is disabled when moving ticket to spam tickets screen. When account is disabled, tickets are not permitted.<br><br>
       <span class="highlightText">Auto Delete Spam Tickets When Ticket is XX Days Old</span> - If set, spam tickets are auto deleted that are a certain amount of days old. Set to 0 to disable. CleanTalk does NOT have to
       be enabled for this feature. Note that this option is actioned when the spam screen is visited in admin.<br><br>
       Note that cleanTalk is not used on the <a href="api1.html">Maian Support API</a>. If you are utilising the API you should implement your own spam checks before submitting the data.

      This option lets you re-order the off canvas menu menu areas or hide them if you don't want them to display. Note that
      hiding them does NOT disable the pages, it just hides the menu option. This can be a quick way of hiding pages from team
      members rather than setting permissions on the support team page. Or you may just wish to disable options you don't use.<br><br>

	    Note that menu changes will only take affect if the 'Apply Menu Changes - Only Set if Checked' button is checked before
	    you click 'Update Settings'.<br><br>
	    Once the menu has been changed, you'll need to refresh the admin area to see the changes. When the menu has been changed
	    a 'Reset Menu' option will appear on the Nav Menu Options page. Clicking that reverts the menu to it's default view.
